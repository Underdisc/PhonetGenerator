All current documentation can be found in documentation/html/index.html

Will generate words for you based off of the rules of the *English Phonetic Alphabet* rather than just the *English Alphabet*. That's the goal. It generates phonetic versions of words currently, but it is not currently using the rules of the phonetic alphabet. Going to get on that soon.
