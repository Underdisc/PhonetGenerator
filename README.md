# Phonet Genertor

**Compile and Run**
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```

All current documentation can be found in documentation/html/index.html

Will generate words for you based off of the rules of the *English Phonetic Alphabet* rather than just the *English Alphabet*. That's the goal. It generates phonetic versions of words currently, but it is not currently using the rules of the phonetic alphabet. Going to get on that soon.

Planned Features:
- Generate suggested spellings.
- Options for choosing what the program does.
- More robust generation system in order to use any phonetic alphabet.

**Current Version: 0.7**

*Good versions will be in bold*
