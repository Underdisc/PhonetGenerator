{\itshape A Multilingual Word Generator}

This is a program that uses {\itshape Phonetics} to generate randomized words. Instead of using syllables or just characters like other generators, this generator makes words by shoving sounds together that exist within a language. For example, in English, there are 44 different sounds that speakers will make. Using just these 44 sounds, you can say any word in the language.

At first, this generator could only generate words for the English language, but it is now able to generate words for almost any language. It might not be possible for certain languages due to my own lack of knowledge, but producing words for Romantic and Germanic languages should be possible if there are configuration files for the language.

{\itshape If there isn\textquotesingle{}t a configuration file for the language you are looking for, feel free to contribute and add a configuration. A tutorial on how to create and use the configuration files is located at the bottom of this page.}

\subparagraph*{Options}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item --maximum-\/length \mbox{[}number or -\/n \mbox{[}number\mbox{]}\+: Decide the minimum number of phonemes in a phonet.
\item --maximum-\/length \mbox{[}number\mbox{]} or -\/x \mbox{[}number\mbox{]}\+: Decide the maximum number of phonemes in a phonet.
\item --words \mbox{[}number\mbox{]} or -\/w \mbox{[}number\mbox{]}\+: Decide the number of phonets that are generated.
\item --spellings \mbox{[}number\mbox{]} or -\/s \mbox{[}number\mbox{]}\+: Decide the number of suggested spellings that generated for each generated phonet.
\item --pronunciation or -\/p\+: Print the pronunciation of the phonet.
\item --seed \mbox{[}number\mbox{]} or -\/r \mbox{[}number\mbox{]}\+: Provide the seed used for the randomization. If a seed is not provided, the time is used as the alternative.
\item --file \mbox{[}path\mbox{]} or -\/ f \mbox{[}path\mbox{]}\+: Choose the phoneme file that will be used for the phoneme data used by the generator.
\item --help or -\/h\+: Print this.

Version List
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Basic implementation versions
\item 0.\+70 -\/ Contains a very basic generation method. The method used in this version switches back and forth between vowel and consonant phonemes. This version generates interesting phonets, however, it does not have an option interface
\item 0.\+80 -\/ Suggests a single spelling for any Phonet generated.
\item 0.\+90 -\/ Added an options interface for the Phonet\+Generator.
\item 0.\+91 -\/ Added more options and organized the output.
\item 0.\+92 -\/ Added a help option.
\item 0.\+93 -\/ Added long options.
\item {\bfseries 1.\+0} -\/ Added rules.
